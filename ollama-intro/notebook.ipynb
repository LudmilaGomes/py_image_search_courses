    "\n",
    "- Designed for running large language models (LLMs) locally;\n",
    "- Supports macOS, Linux, Windows;\n",
    "- Can be used with CLI, SDK or via API connection;\n",
    "- Compatibility with LangChain!\n",
    "- Supports models like Phi-3, Llama 3, Mistral, Mixtral, Llama2, Multimodal Llava, CodeLama;\n",

    "\n",
    "- `serve`: Launches the ollama service;\n",
    "- `create`: Generates a new model file using a pre-existing model, allowing customization such as setting temperature or adding specific instructions;\n",
    "- `show`: Displays configurations for a specified model;\n",
    "- `list`: Provides a list of all models currently managed within the local environment;\n",
    "- `pull`/`push`: Manages the import and export of models to and from the ollama registry;\n",
    "- `run`: Executes a specified model;\n",
    "- Copy (`cp`) and Remove (`rm`): Manages model files by copying or deleting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `run` command, we have the execution of automated steps: Ollama checks local availability, downloads automatically the model (if not found in the system), initiate model execution and start the chat session in CLI.\n",

They didn\\'t specify if they want sci-fi, real astronomy, poetic, or something else. I should probably pick a direction that\\'s engaging but not too technical. \\n\\nFirst, I wonder about their intent. Are they a kid looking for bedtime story? A student needing homework help? Or just someone curious about space? Since they didn\\'t give details, I\\'ll assume they want something imaginative but grounded enough to feel real. Maybe a mix of wonder and science? \\n\\nI recall they said \"the space\" not \"space\" – wait, that\\'s interesting. In English, \"space\" can mean the void between stars or the physical area. But they wrote \"the space\" which is grammatically odd... unless they meant \"space\" as in the concept? Or maybe it\\'s a typo? I\\'ll go with the cosmic meaning since that\\'s the most common interpretation. \\n\\n*Brainstorming*: Should I do a human story? Like an astronaut? Or something more abstract? Aha! What about a child\\'s perspective? Kids find space magical. I remember that study where kids understand the universe better when they personify it. \\n\\n*Plot idea*: A kid named Leo who\\'s obsessed with stars. But instead of boring facts, he gets a weird gift – a tiny, warm object that *is* space. That\\'s unexpected! The twist: space isn\\'t empty, it\\'s alive with memories. That feels fresh. \\n\\n*Why this works*: \\n- Addresses \"the space\" by making it a character (not just the void) \\n- Avoids sci-fi clichés (no aliens, no spaceships) \\n- Has emotional depth (Leo\\'s loneliness vs. cosmic connection) \\n- Ends with hope – space as a shared memory, not something distant \\n\\n*Potential pitfalls*: \\nDon\\'t overdo the science. Keep it simple: \"quantum foam\" is too jargony. Instead, say \"the universe\\'s heartbeat\" – poetic but accurate enough. \\nUser might expect action, but this is quiet. Should I add a small conflict? Maybe Leo\\'s fear of being alone? But the story already shows his loneliness through the gift... \\n\\n*Final check*: \\n- Title: \"The Space Between Stars\" – hints at both physical gap and emotional distance \\n- Ending: Leaves room for thought (is space *really* empty?) without being preachy \\n- Added sensory details (cold metal, warm light) so it feels real \\n\\n*User satisfaction*: If they wanted something short, this is 300 words. If they wanted deep science, I skipped it. But since they said \"story,\" not \"explanation,\" I think this hits the mark. \\n\\n...Time to write. I\\'ll start with Leo\\'s quiet moment in the backyard – instant relatability.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere’s a short, heartfelt story about space—written from the perspective of a child who sees the universe not as a distant void, but as a place full of quiet magic:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**The Space Between Stars**  \\n\\nLeo was ten years old and spent his afternoons in the backyard of his small house in the mountains. His dad worked long hours, and Leo’s mother had left months ago. So Leo had his own space: the sky.  \\n\\nEvery night, he’d lie on the grass, knees drawn up, and watch the stars. Not the bright ones—the ones that *felt* like they were breathing. He’d learned from his grandfather that stars were like fireflies in the dark, but Leo saw more. He saw *space*—not empty, but full of things that didn’t make sound.  \\n\\nOne evening, as the moon hung low and the stars were sharp as needles, Leo noticed a tiny, warm light near the edge of the sky. It wasn’t a star. It wasn’t a planet. It was *space itself*, like a small, soft breath of the universe.  \\n\\nHe reached out with his finger—just an inch—and the light grew warm. Then, it *spoke*. Not with words, but with a feeling: *You’re not alone*.  \\n\\nLeo gasped. He’d never told anyone about this. He’d never felt space *talk*.  \\n\\nThe light pulsed gently, like a heartbeat. It showed him things:  \\n- The way the moon’s shadow moved across the earth like a slow, silent hand.  \\n- How the stars were the universe’s *memories*—each one a story from a time before time.  \\n- That the space between stars wasn’t empty, but *full* of love, hope, and the quiet hum of everything that ever was.  \\n\\nThen, the light faded. Leo sat up, his hands shaking. The backyard was silent again. But he knew something had changed.  \\n\\nHe didn’t look for the stars that night. Instead, he sat by his window and whispered: *“I remember you.”*  \\n\\nThe next morning, he found a single, perfect dandelion seed on his pillow. It was the size of a tiny star.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Why this story works for \"the space\"**:  \\n- It treats **space** (the cosmic void) as a living, emotional presence—not just a physical distance.  \\n- It shows space as *connected* to human feeling (loneliness, hope, memory), answering the unspoken question: *“Why does space feel so big, yet so intimate?”*  \\n- No aliens, no robots, no tech—just a child’s wonder and the quiet truth that **space is where we all belong**.  \\n\\nSpace isn’t just the emptiness between stars. It’s the space *inside* us too.  \\n\\n*(P.S. If you’d like a sci-fi twist, a cosmic adventure, or even a poem about space—just say the word! I’d love to write more.)* 🌌', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 40451, 752, 264, 3364, 911, 279, 3550, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 151667, 198, 32313, 11,
