    "# [Deploying a Vision Transformer Deep Learning Model with FastAPI in Python](https://pyimagesearch.com/2024/09/23/deploying-a-vision-transformer-deep-learning-model-with-fastapi-in-python/)\n",

    "Vision Transformers process an image by dividing it into patches, treating each patch as a sequence element, much like words in a sentence. This approach allows Vision Transformers to capture global contextual information across an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of Vision Transformers lies in their ability to model relationships between distant parts of an image, which traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) might struggle to capture.\n",
